 # This program demonstrates the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)through a simulation of animal management in a farm setting.
 It features:
* - Dynamic object initialization for animals.
* - Implementation of class methods to modify and access animal attributes.
* - Use of encapsulation to safeguard the integrity of animal data.
* - A menu-driven interface that handles user interactions effectively.
* - Demonstrates the utility of constructors, destructors, and friend functions.
* - Efficient input validation and error handling for user inputs.
